This is the API wrapper for Corpus-DB, a textual corpus database for the digital humanities. Read more about it [at this introductory blog post](http://jonreeve.com/2017/06/project-gutenberg-the-database/). 

Scripts used to generate the database are in the [gitenberg-experiments repo](https://github.com/JonathanReeve/gitenberg-experiments). 

# Contributing

I could use some help with this, especially if you know Python or Haskell, have library or bibliography experience, or simply like books. Get in touch in the chat room above, or [contact me via email](mailto:jon.reeve@gmail.com).
